Update: Feb 5, 2021

We will not be directly hosting the CSV files for Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports in this repository going forward.

The CSVs are available in the following locations:
- Explore or download the data using our [interactive charts](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/).
- Run queries in Google Cloudâ€™s [COVID-19 Public Dataset Program](http://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19_google_mobility).
- Analyze the data alongside other covariates in the [COVID-19 Open-Data repository](https://goo.gle/covid-19-open-data).
